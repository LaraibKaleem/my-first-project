## 🎓 Reflections

### What Went Well
- Fast-paced learning and immediate implementation
- Building both technical (GitHub) and professional (LinkedIn) presence simultaneously
- Having a structured roadmap makes progress measurable
- Learning by doing is more effective than just watching tutorials

### Challenges Faced
- Understanding folder structures initially
- Remembering Git commands (but practice helps!)
- Writing compelling LinkedIn content
- Balancing course work with portfolio building

### What I'll Do Differently
- Commit to GitHub more frequently (daily habit)
- Engage on LinkedIn daily (even just 10 minutes)
- Document learnings immediately (not at end of week)
- Take more breaks to absorb information
