# Data Folder

This folder contains datasets used in the project.

## Datasets
### Why: Separate data from code
### What goes here: CSV files, JSON, small datasets
### Example: train.csv, test.csv, sample_data.json

## Files
- Sample datasets (small files only)
- Data should be under 10MB
- Larger datasets: provide download links

## Data Sources
- [List your data sources here]
- Example: Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, etc.

## Note
- Don't commit large files (>10MB)
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large datasets
